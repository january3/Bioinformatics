## Reasons for the reproducibility crisis: Lack of transparcency

 * no access to primary data
 * no precise description of methods:

```
We used generalized linear models (R package nlme4) to test the
significance of association.
```

Fine, but how exactly was the model formulated? How many covariates? What
transformations? What data were used? Which function? Were the results
corrected for multiple testing? Etc., etc., etc.

## Hypothesis testing in science

A primer on scientific method:

--

*Kill your darlings*

--

Rather than trying to *prove* your hypothesis, try to *disprove it*. Only a
hypothesis which resists repeated attempts to overthrow it is useful.

---

## Statistical hypothesis testing

A primer on statistical hypothesis testing:

You create two models which can explain your data. One you call $H_0$, the
other one $H_1$. 

--

The models differ by one tiny assumption, e.g. that the groups considered
differ.

--

Now you ask the question: which of the models is better?

---

## Statistical hypothesis testing

Most frequently, we test this as follows:

 * we take the first model, $H_0$, and calculate the probability of
   generating our data using that model

--

 * if this probability is very low, we conclude that the model is not
   sufficient to explain the observed data

--

 * therefore we reject it in favor of the other model.
 


---

## Statitical hypothesis testing in science ✪

 * Both $H_0$ and $H_1$ make certain assumptions like normality. The only
   difference is in the effect; usually, $H_0$ assumes no effect, $H_1$
   assumes that there is an (unknown) effect
 * The reason why we use p-values calculated based on $H_0$ is *that they
   are easy to calculate analytically* (i.e., without a fast computer).

---

## What are p-values 

...imagine we toss a coin...


---

## What are p-values

Meaning of probability is different in classical (frequentist) statistics
and in bayesian statistics

 * in frequentist statistics, this is the probability of getting a
   similar or better result assuming the $H_0$. $\Rightarrow$ a coin
   that has landed is an event that happened, therefore p=1 OR p=0, but
   not p=0.5
 * in bayesian statistics, it is a measure of information (much as our
   intuition tells us!) $\Rightarrow$ as long as we don't know how the
   coin landed, we can use p=0.5



---

## What are p-values 

p-values are defined within frequentist hypothesis testing.

P-value gives us the average FPR (false positive rate, type I error rate)
if we do many experiments, assuming the $H_0$ ("no effect").

## Music makes people literally younger

"*[W]e asked 20 University of Pennsylvania undergraduates to listen to
either “When I’m Sixty-Four” by The Beatles or “Kalimba.” Then, in an
ostensibly unrelated task, they indicated their birth date (mm/dd/yyyy) and
their father’s age. We used father’s age to control for variation in
baseline age across participants*.

*An ANCOVA revealed the predicted effect: According to their birth dates,
**people were nearly a year-and-a-half younger after listening to “When I’m
Sixty-Four” (adjusted M = 20.1 years) rather than to “Kalimba” (adjusted M
= 21.5 years), F(1, 17) = 4.92, p = .040**.*"

## A short guide to p-hacking

 * p > 0.05? Try another test
 * Or maybe add or remove some covariates?
 * Surely, there are outliers. Remove them.
 * Well, let us collect some more data. And then some more. As long as it
   takes.

## p = 0.05

 * Arbitrary threshold introduced (mostly) by R.A. Fisher
 * In perfect circumstances, guarantees a false positive rate of 1 in 20

```
Q: Why do so many colleges and grad schools teach p = 0.05?

A: Because that's still what the scientific community and journal editors use.

Q: Why do so many people still use p = 0.05?

A: Because that's what they were taught in college or grad school.

---

## Is p = 0.05 enough?

Consider a test for a disease (like a test for Sars-Cov-2 infection). 

 * Sensitivity 80%: that is, no more than 20% False Negatives (FNs)
 * Specificity 95%: no more than 5% False Positives (FPs)

Imagine you are tested and that the result is positive. What is the
probability that you are infected with Sars-Cov-2?


(**Note:** in reality, the Sars-Cov-2 tests are *much* more sensitive and
specific)

## Is p = 0.05 enough?

OK, now replace "Sars-Cov-2 test" with "hypothesis test".

 * 80% sensitivity is normal for statistical tests (80% power)

 * 95% specificity corresponds to our p = 0.05

How many (scientific) hypotheses we are testing are really correct?

 * Surely much less than 100%, if it was close to 100% we would not be using
   statistics!
 * But more than 0%, we would not be doing science otherwise
 * Say, it is 10% (maybe 30% on a good day, but maybe 1% on a bad one).

---

## Effect sizes: are men smarter than women?


--

 * There are a few papers that indicate that men either have a higher IQ,
   or a larger variability

--

 * However, there is actually strong support to state that there are no
   actual differences apart from possibly some environmental priming (as
   in: boys are expected to understand maths)

--

 * Even if we take the paper showing differences for granted, these
   differences are as minuscule as the ones on previous plot

--

 * Whether or not there are population differences should *never*
   matter for an individual case (and sexism / discrimination based on sex
   in the STEM fields – science, technology, engineering, maths – is well
   documented, also by scientific experiments)

---

## Bottom line ✪

 * p-value is a part of scientific *language*. Participating in
   scientific communication (reading and writing papers) is dangerous if
   you do not understand what it means.

--

 * p-values never tell us about the probability of $H_1$

--

 * p-values are meaningless when we reject $H_0$! They refer to an
   alternate universe in which we assume that $H_0$ is true

--

 * p-values can be "extremely significant" (incorrect phrase!), but the
   effect may still be very small. "Statistically significant" is not the
   same as "significant".

--

 * p-values are calculated given certain assumptions (the null hypothesis, $H_0$), and not
   "randomness". This can lead to errors if these assumptions are not met.
   Examples: independence, normality

--

 * Absence of evidence (i.e. significance) is not evidence of absence (of
   the effect). That means: lack of statistical significance is not
   *evidence* that there is no effect. 

--

 * p-value is a *tool*. Like any tool, it can be incorrectly used. It will
   not make a decision for you.

 * The Japanese drink very little red wine and suffer fewer heart attacks than the British or Americans.

--

 * The Italians drink excessive amounts of red wine and also suffer fewer heart attacks than the British or Americans.

--

 * The Germans drink a lot of beer and eat lots of sausages and fats and suffer fewer heart attacks than the British or Americans.

(actually: most of the facts above are **untrue!**)

## Correlation and causation

Say, you observe that people who express certain behavior (**B**) also tend to
succumb to a certain disease (**D**). Several explanations are possible:

 * **B** causes **D**
 * There is a common factor that causes both **D** and **B** 
    * Predisposition to **D** causes **B** 
    * Predisposition to **B** is linked with predisposition to **D**

Should we dismiss **B** as a cause for **D**?

## What can we do as scientists? ✪

 * registered studies, SOPs etc.: plan and publish the analysis before
   performing it
 * be as transparent as possible
    * publish data
    * publish methods as code on github (or similar)
 * learn statistics
 * KILL YOUR DARLINGS


---

## What can we do as non-scientists? ✪

 * Beware of the hype
 * Always check the sources
 * Learn how to read scientific papers
 * Confront the sources (there is always another opinion)
 * Learn statistics

---

## Introduction to the report: rules ✪

 * You will do the report in Rmarkdown or Jupyter lab book.
 * You will be given a sequence (actually, you will be able to choose the
   sequence yourself). With this sequence you will have to complete a
   number of tasks:
   * Use BLAST (or another tool) to determine what is the protein that this
     sequence corresponds to.
   * Predict secondary structure of the sequence.
   * Find what protein domains are in the sequence.
   * Find the structure of a similar protein in PDB, compare the structure
     with the predictions of secondary structure
   * Use BLAST to find a number of similar sequences
   * Create an MSA
   * Create a phylogenetic tree

---

## Writing the report ✪

 * With these tasks complete, you write a report
 * Report must be written in Rmarkdown
 * You must create a bibliography file and include the references
 * Like a scientific paper, the report must include the following parts:
    * Abstract: short description of your work
    * Introduction: explain what is the background of your work (e.g. why
      analysing proteins is important)
    * Methods: describe, *in detail*, the methods you will apply. Cite sources!
    * Results: describe, *with figures*, your findings. 
    * Discussion: what is your opinion? what else should / could one do?  What did you learn?
    * Bibliography

---

## Writing the report ✪

There are three types of statements:

 * Statements by others: you must cite them.
 * Statements derived from your findings: you must back them up with results
 * Statements which are speculative: you must label them clearly as such
