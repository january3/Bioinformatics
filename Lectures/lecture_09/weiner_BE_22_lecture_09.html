## Plan for today

 * Gene set enrichment analysis
    * 1st generation: hypergeometric test, Fisher's exact test
    * 2nd generation: other algorithms
    * 3rd generation: pathway topology analysis


---

## Gene ontology database✪ 

.pull-left[

GO – Gene Ontology

 * Genes are assigned to GO categories
 * GO categories are assigned to each other
 * GO can be represented as a *directed acyclic graph*

]

.pull-right[

---

## Gene ontology database✪ 

 * Three main categories: biological process (BP), molecular function (MF), cellular
   component (CC)
 * Each category is a so-called "directed acyclic graph" (DAG)
 * Each gene can be assigned to multiple categories
 * Each category can have multiple "parents" and "children" (so it is not a
   tree!)

## Other gene sets

Different lists of genes can be obtained from various sources.

 * Coexpression data sets: groups of genes that have correlated expression
   profiles

--

 * Results from another differential gene expression analysis experiment:
   groups of genes significant in a comparison

--

 * Targets of a particular miRNA determined computationally

## Group of genes, and then what?✪ 

First, define DEGs: differentially expressed genes (e.g.
`abs(log2FoldChange) &gt; 1`, `adj_p_val &lt; 0.001`)

Second, define which genes are in a given gene set (GS), and which are not.

## Disadvantages of the generation 1 approach

 * You have to define DEGs... but that depends on the number of samples
    * the larger the number of samples, the higher statistical power
    * the higher statistical power, the more DEGs you can detect
    * therefore, the results depend on an arbitrary threshold

 * What to do if you have no DEGs at all?

---

## Generation 2 approaches – "Functional Class Sorting"

 * do not depend on arbitrary thresholds

---

## GSEA algorithm✪ 

![](images/GSEA-homegraphic.gif)

---

## GSEA algorithm

 * Calculate the (pseudo) Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic for each gene set
 * The statistic has a value, but no associated p-value
 * Test the statistic and obtain a p-value by a permutation test

---

## Permutation tests in statistics

 * Normally, for a given statistic (like the t-test statistic or chi-squared
   statistic), you can calculate a p-value from the known distribution of
   the statistic
 * If you don't know the distribution, you can simulate it by permuting the
   data
 * Advantages: no assumptions about the distribution of the statistic
 * Disadvantages: computationally expensive, and more importantly: you need
   a sufficient number of samples

---

## tmod algorithm

 * Arrange the genes according to p-value or another similar metrics
 * Test whether genes from a given gene set are denser on the beginning of
   the list

### Tmod statistics

Since normalized ranking for a gene `\(i\)`

`\(r'_{i}=\frac{r_i}{N} \sim U(0,1)\)`

--

then

`\(-\ln{r'_{i}} \sim Exp(1)\)`

--

and

`\(-2\cdot\ln{r'_i} \sim \chi^2_2\)`

--

thus, if `\(G\)` is a set of genes,

`\(-2\cdot\sum_{i \in G}\ln{r'_i} \sim \sum_{i \in G}\chi^2_2 \sim \chi^2_{2\cdot n(G)}\)`

This gives a fast and reliable statistics with a known distribution which
can be used to associate a p-value to any set of genes.
