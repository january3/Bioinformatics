## Domains show on a dotplot ✪

`RASA1_HUMAN` – Ras GTPase-activating protein 1. Inhibitory regulator of the Ras-cyclic AMP pathway – role in metabolism.

`SOCS1_HUMAN` – Suppressor of cytokine signaling 1. Induced by several
cytokines, inhibits the STAT pathway (so acts effectively as a
self-regulator, negative feedback).

## Bottom line ✪ 

 * There are millions of different protein sequences
   (depending how you count!)

--

 * There are maybe 40 main structural architectures, a thousand or two of
   main topologies and fewer than 10000 of homologous superfamilies

--

 * All these millions of proteins consist of these couple of thousands of
   building blocks

--

 * Some building blocks are particularly ubiquitous, but most are rare
   (power law again!)

---

## Global vs. local alignments

 * Reminder: BLAST searches are (mostly) local. That means, one can find
homologs which share just a single domain.

---

## Homologs and partial homology

 * Most people say "high homology" when they mean "high similarity", this
   is incorrect! Homology is binary: it either is or it isn't (either there
   is a common ancestor or not)
 * However, *fragments* of sequence may be homologous (and the rest of the
   sequences not) – e.g. two SH3 domains in otherwise different proteins.
   This is *partial* homology.

---

## Searching for domains: PSI-BLAST

"Position-Specific Iterative BLAST"

.pull-left[
![](images/psiblast.png)
]

.pull-right[
 1. Find a number of sequences with a query
 2. Select some of the hits
 3. Construct a PSSM from the hits
 4. Search again
 5. Go to (3.) until satisfied with the outcome

---

## Searching for domains: HMMER

.pull-left[
![](images/hmmer.png)
]

.pull-right[

![](images/hmmer_model.png)

**M** – "match states"
**I** – "insertion states"
**D** – "deletion states"
]

HMMER builds a Hidden Markov Model from multiple sequence alignment

This is a PSSM on steroids and works remarkably well!


---

## Beyond BLAST: Protein-protein search using HMMER


  * Create a profile out of an MSA, search a protein database using the
    profile

--

  * Create a database of profiles, search with a query sequence

--

  * Create a profile from a single sequence, search a database of sequences
    using this query profile (works like BLAST)

--

  * `jackhammer`: search with a sequence, collect hits, improve profile,
    search with the improved profile (works like PSI-BLAST)

## Transmembrane domains

Transmembrane domains are characterized by a high hydrophobicity;
Kyte-Doolittle hydropathy score takes advantage of this fact. Again, a
sliding window is used to calculate average hydropathy.

## Example

Zanamivir – influenza treatment; neuraminidase inhibitor

 * neuraminidase binds to sialic acid on our cells making virus entry
   possible; one of the major antigens
 * 3D structure of neuraminidase: 1980
 * 1993: computational study of the active site, rational design of new drugs (Mark von Itzstein)
 * One of the drugs was very effective

## AlphaFold

 * Based on the Alphabet ("Google") DeepMind team
 * outclassed all competition in the CASP13 (2018) and CASP14 (2020)
   competitions
 * open source
 * game changer

---

## How does it work?

![](images/alphafold2.png)


---

 * Find homologous proteins from other organisms and create an MSA
 * In parallel, look for similar structures and create a "pairwise"
   amino-acid contact matrix (how likely each amino acid is to interact
   with another amino acid) ("template")
 * this two parts of information are passed to so called *transformers*
   (which interact, so the information is exchanged between these two).
   This creates a better representation of MSA and the 

But that is just the start.

---

## Evoformer

 * The key idea is that MSA and the template are not only *inputs*, but
   also *outputs* of the neuronal network. That is, the information from
   the template allows to construct a better MSA, and a better MSA allows
   achieving a better template.
 * This is so-called "transformer" architecture. Being no specialist in
   deep learning, I cannot tell you much about that. Please read
   [this](https://www.blopig.com/blog/2021/07/alphafold-2-is-here-whats-behind-the-structure-prediction-miracle/)
   if you are interested.
 * In fact, none of the ideas behind AlphaFold 2 are revolutionary: this
   has been cooking (and used by other algorithms as well) for several
   years. However, AlphaFold 2 is still superior to all the other solutions
   – potentially because it is better made.
