## Protein structure databases ✪

 * PDB – the original one
 * Hierarchical classification of structures
  * [SCOP 2](https://scop.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/)
    * Families (close evolutionary relationships)
    * Superfamilies (distant relationships)
    * Folds ("types" of superfamilies)
  * [CATH](https://www.cathdb.info/)
 * Sequence-based protein family databases
   * [PFAM](https://pfam.xfam.org)
   * [CDD](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/cdd)

## Domains show on a dotplot ✪

`RASA1_HUMAN` – Ras GTPase-activating protein 1. Inhibitory regulator of the Ras-cyclic AMP pathway – role in metabolism.

`SOCS1_HUMAN` – Suppressor of cytokine signaling 1. Induced by several
cytokines, inhibits the STAT pathway (so acts effectively as a
self-regulator, negative feedback).

## Bottom line ✪ 

 * There are millions of different protein sequences
   (depending how you count!)

--

 * There are maybe 40 main structural architectures, a thousand or two of
   main topologies and fewer than 10000 of homologous superfamilies

--

 * All these millions of proteins consist of these couple of thousands of
   building blocks

--

 * Some building blocks are particularly ubiquitous, but most are rare
   (power law again!)

---

## Global vs. local alignments

 * Reminder: BLAST searches are (mostly) local. That means, one can find
homologs which share just a single domain.

---

## Homologs and partial homology

 * Most people say "high homology" when they mean "high similarity", this
   is incorrect! Homology is binary: it either is or it isn't (either there
   is a common ancestor or not)
 * However, *fragments* of sequence may be homologous (and the rest of the
   sequences not) – e.g. two SH3 domains in otherwise different proteins.
   This is *partial* homology.

---

## Searching for domains: PSI-BLAST

"Position-Specific Iterative BLAST"

.pull-left[
![](images/psiblast.png)
]

.pull-right[
 1. Find a number of sequences with a query
 2. Select some of the hits
 3. Construct a PSSM from the hits
 4. Search again
 5. Go to (3.) until satisfied with the outcome

---

## Searching for domains: HMMER

.pull-left[
![](images/hmmer.png)
]

.pull-right[

![](images/hmmer_model.png)

**M** – "match states"
**I** – "insertion states"
**D** – "deletion states"
]

HMMER builds a Hidden Markov Model from multiple sequence alignment

This is a PSSM on steroids and works remarkably well!


---

## Beyond BLAST: Protein-protein search using HMMER


  * Create a profile out of an MSA, search a protein database using the
    profile

--

  * Create a database of profiles, search with a query sequence

--

  * Create a profile from a single sequence, search a database of sequences
    using this query profile (works like BLAST)

--

  * `jackhammer`: search with a sequence, collect hits, improve profile,
    search with the improved profile (works like PSI-BLAST)

## Transmembrane domains

Transmembrane domains are characterized by a high hydrophobicity;
Kyte-Doolittle hydropathy score takes advantage of this fact. Again, a
sliding window is used to calculate average hydropathy.

## Example

Zanamivir – influenza treatment; neuraminidase inhibitor

 * neuraminidase binds to sialic acid on our cells making virus entry
   possible; one of the major antigens
 * 3D structure of neuraminidase: 1980
 * 1993: computational study of the active site, rational design of new drugs (Mark von Itzstein)
 * One of the drugs was very effective
