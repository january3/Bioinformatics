$\delta^{13}C$ – measurement of the ratio of $^{13}C$ to $^{12}C$,
normalized to a common standard.
biological processes preferably take the lighter $^{12}C$ isotope.


$$\delta^{13}C = \left(\frac{\left(\frac{^{13}C}{^{12}C}\right)_{sample}}{\left(\frac{^{13}C}{^{12}C}\right)_{standard}} - 1\right) \times 1000$$

Do not confuse with 14C/12C ratio! the mechanism is completely different

organic matter has low delta 13C values – -20 or so; bicarbonate has like 0
(standard is high in 13C)

Water can be detected using 18O / 16O ratio: water loses 18O and the
minerals absorb it, increasing its fraction

Yeah, so first I introduced a new domain, making 3, and now it seems that
there are 2 after all...

Supertrees -- because alternative is concatenation, and the problem with
concatenation is that you must have the family in each of the species

LBA - basically, some phylogeny methods tend to cluster together branches
that are very long.

# Eigen's paradox

Eigen constructed a mathematical model of nucleotide replication based
evolution, involving an *error threshold*. Basically,

 * evolution is possible when the error rate is below the error threshold
 * error threshold depends on the number of nucleotides
 * therefore, the maximum length of the RNA molecule able to replicate
   depends on the threshold.

The paradoxon:

 * short molecules have high error rates, but
 * high error rates require even shorter molecules

For example, at 90% fidelity, the replicating molecule cannot be longer
than 12 nucleotides.
