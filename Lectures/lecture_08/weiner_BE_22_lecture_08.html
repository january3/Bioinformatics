## Plan for today

 * Gene expression analysis – as an in-depth example of high-throughput
   analyses

---

## Transcriptomic methods

 * QPCR: precise, low-throughput
 * Nanostring: precise, mid-throughput (~ 500-1000 genes)
 * Microarray: less exact, high-throughput, pre-defined genes
 * RNA-Seq: very flexible, less exact, high-throughput

---

## QC – quality control

 * Method-dependent quality measures
   * aligned reads
   * duplications
   * intron / exon binding
   * Y chromosome binding
   * adapter content
 * Bias? Clustering?

---

## Heatmaps of the most variable genes

---

## Differential gene expression analysis

 * Finding differences between groups
 * Models may vary

---

## GLMs – generalized linear models
 
 * OLS – ordinary least squares regression
 * Fit data (independent + dependent variables) to a model – a bit like in
   OLS
 * Differences to OLS
   * **link function** allows models in which variables have
     non-normal distributions
   * maximum likelihood estimation (rather than least squares)
 * Count data: negative binomial distribution of the dependent variables

---

## GLMs – generalized linear models

For a given gene, we assume that its counts in a sample `\(i\)` have negative
binomial distribution:

 `$$\text{counts} \sim f_{\text{binom}}(\mu_i, \alpha)$$`

(Negative binomial distribution is a generalization of a Poisson
distribution that you might know)

Statistical test:

 **Null hypothesis `\(H_0\)`:** For each sample `\(i\)`, `\(\mu_i = \mu_0\)`

 **Alternative hypothesis `\(H_1\)`:** 

 `$$\log{\mu_i} = \beta_0 + x_i \times \beta_G$$`

Where 


 `$$\beta_G = \left\{\begin{array}{ll}0 &amp; x_i \text{is control} \\ 1 &amp; x_i \text{is treatment}\end{array}\right.$$`

This model is then tested against the `\(H_0\)` using a Wald test.


---

## Correction for multiple testing

.pull-left[

Statistical testing is like a russian roulette: each time you test, you
have a chance of drawing a False Positive (FP). If you draw many times, you
are bound to have "significant" FP's. 

 * Family-wise error correction (e.g. Bonferroni): guarantees that the
   chance of having 1 or more FP's in the results significant at `\(\alpha\)`
   is `\(\alpha\)`.
 * False-discovery rate (FDR; e.g. Benjamini-Hochberg): guarantees that the
   *fraction* of FP's in the results significant at `\(\alpha\)` is no more
   than `\(\alpha\)`.

]

.pull-right[

 **Remember:** any results not corrected for multiple testing are *not
 trustworthy!* 

]


---

## R equation language

R uses a particular representation of linear model equations:

e.g. 

 `$$y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times y$$`

is represented as

 `y ~ x`

Whereas 

 `$$y = \beta_1 \times y$$`

(no intercept, i.e. intercept `\(= 0\)`)

becomes

 `y ~ 0 + x`

   identification of "transcriptional modules"

### From correlations to distances

 `\(d_{i,j}\)` – Distance between genes `\(i\)` and `\(j\)`

 `\(\rho(x_i, x_j)\)` – correlation coefficient between expression of `\(i\)` `\(x_i\)` and `\(j\)` `\(x_j\)`

Hard threshold:

 `$$d_{i,j} \equiv \left\{\begin{array}{ll}0 &amp; |\rho(x_i, x_j)| &gt; \tau\\1 &amp; |\rho(x_i, x_j)| \leq \tau\end{array}\right.$$`

Continuouos in `\((0, 1)\)`

 `$$d_{i,j} \equiv 1 - |\rho(x_i, x_j)|$$`

background-image:url(images/correlation_dependence.png)



---

## Many alternatives

 Other measures exist:

   * mutual information
   * different types of correlation (Spearman `\(\rho\)`, Kendall `\(\tau\)`)
   * distance correlation (Székely 2007)


Bottom line: we need to get at distances

### Hierarchical clustering

 * Start with each element in its own cluster: `\(n_{\text{clust}} = N\)`
 * Identify two elements with the smallest distance
 * Recalculate distances using a *linkage* function

E.g. complete linkage:

 `$$D(C_i, C_j) = \max_{e_i \in C_i, e_j \in C_j} D(e_i, e_j)$$`

Basically: join the clusters with the smalles distance between the
*furthest* elements of the clusters

E.g. single linkage:

 `$$D(C_i, C_j) = \min_{e_i \in C_i, e_j \in C_j} D(e_i, e_j)$$`

Basically: join the clusters with the smalles distance between the
*closest* elements of the clusters

---
class:empty-slide,mywhite
background-image:url(images/hclust.png)


---

## k-means

Naive k-means:

 * Assign the elements to random clusters
 * Repeat:
   * Calculate the cluster centroids (midpoints) 
   * Assign the elements to the cluster with the closest centroid
   * Abort if the asignments no longer change

## The elbow method

.pull-left[
There is a total amount of variance in the clusters.

We can split it into *between cluster* variance and *within cluster*
variance.

Instead of variance, we use Sum of Squares (SS), because `\(Var(x)\equiv \frac{SS}{n-1}\)`.

 `$$SS_{\text{tot}} = SS_{\text{within}} + SS_{\text{between}}$$`

 * If all elements are in one large cluster, `\(SS_{\text{between}}= 0\)`.
 * If all elements are each in a separate cluster, `\(SS_{\text{within}}= 0\)`.
