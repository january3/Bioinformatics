## Ridiculome

.pull-left[
"As the -ome names imply, we expect such data to be complete collections of
components and/or properties. The problem is that they are neither complete
nor correct. It has been argued that they often do not help understanding,
and have occasionally been called the 'ridiculome'."

## Common characteristics of high throughput data sets✪ 

  * a lot more variables than samples, $p >> n$
  * many unknown / uncharacterized variables
  * atypical distributions
  * frequently:
      * batch effects
      * systematic bias
      * relative data (as opposed to absolute measurements in SI units)
      * large uncertainties for individual data points
      * huge files

# Sequencing

.pull-left[

### Cluster amplification

 * ligation of the cDNA to the flowcell
 * amplification in situ
 * results in spots ("clusters") with homogenous DNA

.pull-right[

]

---

.pull-left[

### Sequencing

 * "Sequencing by synthesis": Step-wise extension of the sequences
 * in each cycle, only one nucleotide is added: a protective group (-OH)
   does not allow incorporation of another nucleotide
 * a snapshot of the flow cell is taken; each cluster appears as a dot, the
   color corresponds to the last dNTP incorporated
 * fluorescence is deactivated, -OH protective group removed and another
   cycle begins

### Bioinformatics

 * convert image data to (compressed) text files (fastq files)
 * demultiplex: split sequences based on the index
 * trim adapters
 * align to a genome / exome (SAM/BAM files)

]

.pull-right[

![](images/alignment.png)

]

---

## Annotation & GTF files

![](images/gtf.png)

 * GTF files: Gene Transfer Format
 * contain information about gene models
 * e.g. chromosome, start, end, strand, gene name, transcript name, exon
   number, exon start, exon end

---

## FASTQ files✪ 

![](images/fastq.png)

Lines:

 1. Identifier
 2. Sequence of the read
 3. End of the sequence (`+`), optionally identifier again
 4. Phred quality score


---

## Phred quality score✪ 

 $$Q \stackrel{\text{def}}{=} -10 \cdot \log_{10}P$$


So if $Q = 10$, then error probability is 1 in 10 (one zero); if $Q = 50$, error
probability is 1 in $100,000$ (five zeros).

The $P$ (probability) is derived empirically from the signal / noise ratio
(and other metrics) in the raw data.

The number is then mapped on ASCII codes of characters, e.g. `A` has the
code of 65, which corresponds to $Q = 65 - 33 = 32$; `]` has the ASCII code
93, so $Q = 93 - 33 = 60$.

---

## SAM and BAM files✪ 

![](images/bam.png)

 * contain information about alignment
 * SAM = human readable text format (huge), BAM = same data but binary for
   smaller size and quicker access
 
---

## Long read sequencing

 Short reads: 50-300 bp (Illumina), 300-600 bp (Ion Torrent). Problems:

 * repetitive regions (long terminal repeats - LTRs; retrotransposons; LINE
   elements - long interspersed nuclear elements)
 * structural variants (e.g. inversions, translocations, duplications)

Long read sequencing:

 * Methods:
   * PacBio: 10,000-100,000 bp
   * Oxford Nanopore, 10,000-1,000,000 bp
 
 * Problems of long read sequencing:
   * high error rate (but some methods / newest chemistry have much higher accuracy,
     e.g. PacBio HiFi or newest chemistry from Oxford Nanopore)
   * high cost
   * low throughput


---

## Long read sequencing:PacBio

.pull-left[
PacBio: DNA polymerase with attached fluorescent nucleotides
  * a single molecule of DNA polymerase is immobilized on a surface in a "nanophotonic well"
  * DNA is added to the surface

  * fluorescence is detected in real time
  * fluorescence is deactivated
  * DNA polymerase incorporates another nucleotide
  * repeat

]

---

## Transcriptomic methods

 * QPCR: precise, low-throughput
 * Nanostring: precise, mid-throughput (~ 500-1000 genes)
 * Microarray: less exact, high-throughput, pre-defined genes
 * RNA-Seq: very flexible, less exact, high-throughput


---

## Transcriptomic parameters

(serves as an example of the complexity of each method)

 * Experimental design: number of samples needed? Which groups of samples?
   Which controls?
 * paired end or single end?
 * library size / read depth? (number of reads per sample: 5 millions, 10
   millions, 20 millions?)
 * library preparation:
    * globin depletion?
    * amplification?
    * UMI barcodes? (unique molecular identifiers)

---

## RNA-Seq

.pull-left[
### Library preparation

 * cDNA synthesis (for RNA-Seq)
 * fragmentation
 * ligation of adapter and index sequences (and possibly UMIs, universal
   molecular identifiers)
 * purification (e.g. removing globin sequences)
 * amplification

## Count data

 * Matrix with integer data
 * Rows = genes (or transcripts)
 * Columns = samples

---

## Alternative representations of count data

Library size = total number of reads in a sample

 * (log) counts per million (normalized to library size)
 * RPKM: reads per kilobase of transcript per million reads (normalized to
   transcript length and library size)
 * FPKM: fragments per kilobase of transcript per million reads (normalized
   to transcript length and library size)
 * TPMs: Transcript Per Million, normalized to transcript length and
   library size (but differently)

   genes, or other (prior) analyses

  * Split data by clusters

    the expression of all cells

## Is it all worth it?

![](images/zappaquote.png)

(after Graur et al.)

---

## Example: ENCODE

 * ENCODE = Encyclopedia of DNA Elements
 * Goal: identify all functional elements in the human genome
 * Data: ChIP-Seq, RNA-Seq, DNase-Seq, ATAC-Seq, Hi-C, CAGE, RAMPAGE, etc.

Some claims:

 * 80% of the genome is functional (as defined by "some protein seems to
   sometimes bind to it") -> is it possible?

---

## Immortality of TV sets

 * We know mutation rates, we know mathematics
 * It is not possible for natural selection to maintain 80% of the genome
   functional -> that would imply a huge fitness cost (as in,
   99.9999999999% of the population would have to die)
 * Current estimates rather at 10% of the genome being functional (in the
   evolutionary sense)
 * The fact that a protein binds a certain site doesn't mean that the site does
   anything useful

Graur, Dan, et al. "On the immortality of television sets:“function” in the
human genome according to the evolution-free gospel of ENCODE." Genome
biology and evolution 5.3 (2013): 578-590.

## Some advice

 * New technologies and new applications arise all the time
 * New technology curve: first steeply up, then steeply down, then level out
 * In 10 years, the landscape will be very different (high throughput cheap
   single cell proteomics? spatial single cell transcriptomics?)
 * Learn the meta-trade, not the trade, so you can adapt to new
   technologies:
   * Learn how to program
   * Teach yourself to figure out how to use existing workflows
   * Stick to the reproducibility principles
