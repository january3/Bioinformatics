## Working with Rmarkdown (cont.)

---

## Working with markdown

 1. Try out the following: creating **bold** (`**bold**`), *italics*
    (`*italics*`)
 2. Make a footnote:

            Text with a footnote^[This is the footnote.].

 3. Download an image to your working directory. Insert it into the
    rmarkdown document:

          ![Image caption](image_file_name.jpg)

 4. Create a bullet point and numbered list. What happens if you use
     different numbers or change the order of the numbers? 

 5. Create a link to Google scholar with

           [Google scholar](https://scholar.google.com)

```
 * one
 * two 
 * three

 1. one
 2. two
 3. three
```


---

## Working with markdown

 4. Create a simple table, like this:

```
  Right     Left     Center     Default
-------     ------ ----------   -------
     12     12        12            12
    123     123       123          123
      1     1          1             1
```

---

## Better tables with Rmarkdown

Two colons mean that we access a function from the `knitr` package without
loading it with `library`.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
knitr::kable(iris)
```



---

## Analysis of the iris data set (simple stats)

Before you start doing *anything*, take a look at the iris data set (if you
don't see it, run `data(iris)`). That is, run a few descriptive analyses.

**Note:** Store *every* analysis in Rmarkdown, that is the point of the
exercise.

 1. Use the function `summary()` on the iris data set.

 2. Create a boxplot:

           boxplot(Sepal.Width ~ Species, data=iris)

---

## Analysis of the iris data set (simple stats)

Before we come to hypothesis testing, let us make a PCA (principal
component analysis). We will use the build-in data set iris, which is a
data frame. The first four columns contain the measurements, the fifth is
the only covariate (species).

```{r,echo=TRUE}
pca <- prcomp(iris[,1:4], scale.=TRUE)
```


---

## Analysis of the iris data set (simple stats)

 1. The pca object is a list. What elements does it contain? How can you
    check that?
 2. The element `x` (`pca$x`) contains the principal components. How many
    principal components are there? (why?)
 3. Try using the basic plot function `plot(x, y)` to plot first two
    components.
 4. The `col` option of `plot` takes a character or numeric vector with
    colors (you can use `red`, or you can use `1`, both work). Can you
    create a column in the `iris` data frame containing colors that
    correspond to the species?


---

## Plotting with ggplot2 (very basic!)

.pull-left[

```{r pcaplot,eval=FALSE,echo=TRUE}
df <- cbind(iris, pca$x)
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(df, aes(x=PC1, y=PC2, color=Species)) + 
  geom_point()
```
]

--

.pull-right[

```{r pcaplot}
```

]

---


.pull-left[

```{r pcaplot2,eval=TRUE,echo=TRUE}
df <- cbind(iris, pca$x)
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(df, aes(x=PC1, y=PC2, color=Species)) + 
  geom_point() + ggthemes::theme_tufte()
```
]


.pull-right[

```{r pcaplot3,eval=TRUE,echo=TRUE}
df <- cbind(iris, pca$x)
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(df, aes(x=PC1, y=PC2, color=Species)) + 
  geom_point() + ggthemes::theme_economist_white()
```
]

---

## Very basic statistics

First, a t.test to check whether the differences in Sepal Width between
*I. versicolor* and *I. virginica* are statistically significant.


```{r,echo=TRUE,results="markdown"}
versicolor <- iris$Species == "versicolor"
ver_sw <- iris$Sepal.Width[versicolor]
virginica <- iris$Species == "virginica"
vir_sw <- iris$Sepal.Width[virginica]

t.test(ver_sw, vir_sw)
```

---

## t.test object

 1. Save the output of t.test to a variable.

 2. Examine this variable. Is that a list? What elements does it have?
    Which elements correspond to the output?

 3. Load the library `broom`. What happens when you do 

            tidy(t.test(ver_sw, vir_sw))


---

## Very basic statistics

First, a t.test to check whether the differences in Sepal Width between
*I. versicolor* and *I. virginica* are statistically significant.


```{r,echo=TRUE}
versicolor <- iris$Species == "versicolor"
ver_sw <- iris$Sepal.Width[versicolor]
virginica <- iris$Species == "virginica"
vir_sw <- iris$Sepal.Width[virginica]

t.test(ver_sw, vir_sw)
```

---

## Very basic statistics

A pairwise t-test between each group

```{r,echo=TRUE}
pairwise.t.test(iris$Sepal.Width, iris$Species)
```


---


## Very basic statistics

Next, a simple ANOVA to check whether Species is a significant covariate.


```{r,echo=TRUE,eval=TRUE,results="markdown"}
iris_anova <- aov(Sepal.Width ~ Species, data=iris)
summary(iris_anova)
```


---

## ANOVA post-hoc Tukey's test


```{r echo=TRUE, results="markdown"}
TukeyHSD(iris_anova, "Species")
```



---

## Adding bibliography

 1. Create a new text file called "bibliography.bib". You can do that in
    Rstudio for some OS (simply create a new .R file, but save it as
    "bibliography.bib"). In other OS (notably Windows), you might need to
    create an empty text file and then rename it to "bibliography.bib".
 2. Open the bibliography.bib file in Rstudio or a text editor. Go to
    google scholar and search for a paper on an interesting topic (whatever
    comes to your mind. If you don't know what, look for the paper by
    Watson and Crick on DNA structure).
 3. Click on the citation icon `"`, and then on "BibTex". Copy the contents
    to your newly created bibliography file and save it. Note what the
    identifier of the article is (something like `watson1953structure`).
 4. In your markdown file, add the line `bibliography: bibliography.bib` to
    the header. 
 5. In the body of the markdown file, add somewhere the citation:
    `[@watson1953structure]`. Knit the document and look at the output.
 6. What happens if you use `@watson1953structure` (without brackets),
    `[-@watson1953structure]` or `[@watson1953structure; page 1]`?
 7. Go to [https://www.zotero.org/styles](https://www.zotero.org/styles) and search
    for the citation style of "Nature".
    Download it to your working directory. To the markdown header add the
    line `csl: nature.csl` (or whatever the file is called). Knit and look
    at the output.

## Homework: Rmarkdown analysis of the iris data set

 * Follow the instructions from the practicals to generate an Rmarkdown
   file with the analysis of the iris data set. 
 * Add short comments for each step, indicating what the step is doing.
 * Make sure the Rmd file can be knitted.
 * Submit the Rmd file (only the Rmd file) as your homework.
