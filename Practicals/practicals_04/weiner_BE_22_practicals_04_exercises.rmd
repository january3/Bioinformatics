## Introduction

This session is going to be a little bit different. You will follow what I
do on the screen rather then be left to do the exercises. 

**Aims:**

 * Give you a jump start
 * Give you good habits
 * Proceed along a helix

---

## Example R session

---

## Workspaces

 Workspace is basically a folder which contains a few special files in
 which R stores project-specific data.

  * `Rhistory` (hidden file) – a text file containing all commands that you
    have issued
  * `Rdata` (hidden file) – a binary file containing your workspace (all
    variables created)
  * `<filename>.Rproj` – Rstudio R project file containing some
    rstudio-specific settings (text file)
  * Anything else should be save by you

---

## Exercise

  * Start R studio $\rightarrow$ File $\rightarrow$ New project
    $\rightarrow$ New directory $\rightarrow$ New project and create a new
    project.
  * Examine the Files pane (lower right); what does it indicate?
  * Try to open the ".Rproj" file in a text editor. 
  * Go to File $\rightarrow$ New File $\rightarrow$ $\rightarrow$ R Script
    to create a new R script.
  * In the new file, write a simple R statement, for example:

```
a <- 1:10
```

   * Press Ctrl/Cmd-Enter. 
   * What happens? What do you see in the console? 
   * What do you see under "Environment" on the top right?

---

## A few notes on R

 * Why programming?
 * Why R?
 * Alternatives: Python, matlab, other statistical languages
 * R vs matlab
 * "There is more than one way of doing it" (but one way will usually be
   optimal)

---

## R language basics (demo)

 * Assignment and variables: `a <- 2` or `myBigVar <- "test"`
  * Note: there are no "singletons", everything is a vector (but maybe of
    length one)
 * vectors and multiple assignment: `a <- c(1, 7, 9)`
 * operators: 
   * `3 + 5` 
   * `a * 7` 
   * `5 / /` 
   * `5 %% 7` 
   * `5 %/% 7` 
   * `5^7`
   * operators often are "vectorized", that is they work with vectors:
      * `c(1, 5, 7) * 8`
 * functions: `sum(c(1, 2, 3))`
   * basically everything is a function, even the operators

---

## Exercises

 * create variables: a string, a number using the `<-` operator
   * how to create the variables?
   * how to view the variables?
 * what does `1:5` do?
 * what happens when you add a number to a vector? (i.e. `c(3, 1, 4) + 5`)
 * what happens when you multiply a vector with a number?
 * what happens when you add two vectors?

 * What does the `length()` function do?

---

# Good coding practices

## Remember: language is communication

 * Your code will be seen by others
 * And this is a good thing!
 * Documentation *is* important
 * Reproducibility matters

---

## Literate programming

.pull-right[
I believe that the time is ripe for significantly better documentation
of programs, and that we can best achieve this by considering
programs to be works of literature. Hence, my title: “Literate
Programming.”

Let us change our traditional attitude to the construction of
programs: Instead of imagining that our main task is to instruct a
computer what to do, let us concentrate rather on explaining to
human beings what we want a computer to do.

## Exercise

 * Go to `File` $\rightarrow$ `New File` $\rightarrow$ rmardkown file
 * Experiment with the file:
   * Convert it to HTML
   * Convert it to PDF
   * Convert it to Word document
   * Try changing something: title, text, R code
   * Click on the little wheel (configure) buttons next to code chunks, see
     what they do
 * Create a presentation

---

## Documenting your code

 * Better a lousy documentation than none at all
 * Use spaces, empty lines, comments to structure your code
 * COMMENT, COMMENT, COMMENT
 * Document in plain text files and source code files

---

## Writing code

Keep your code clean:

 * be consistent!
 * use meaningful variable and function names
 * don't use shorthands
 * refactorize
 * create distinct code chunks
 * split the code into meaningful scripts
 * use a formatting style and stick to it

E.g.
http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs109l/unrestricted/resources/google-style.html

---

## Simplify!

 * make your code as simple as possible
 * make your functions versatile and simple
 * use simple data types if possible
 * don't overdo it!

---

## You never know

 * what your code evolves into
 * when you will need to publish it
 * when someone will want to see it

…so prepare in advance!
