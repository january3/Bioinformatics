# Resources

 * Sequence Logos: [link 1](https://weblogo.berkeley.edu/examples.html),
   [link 2](http://weblogo.threeplusone.com/create.cgi)
 * Jaspar database: [Jaspar](http://jaspar.genereg.net/)

 * Multiple sequence alignments (MSA): we will use `clustal omega` or `clustal 2` (= `clustalw`).
   You can use one of the following online interfaces or download the
   program `clustalx`:

     * (preferred) Clustal Omega on EBI web page: [clustalo](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalo/)
     * Clustal W interface: [clustalw](https://www.genome.jp/tools-bin/clustalw) (requires an offline viewer like Jalview)
     * Clustal W interface #2: [clustalw](https://embnet.vital-it.ch/software/ClustalW.html) (requires an offline viewer)
     * Alternatively, download and install `clustalx` from [here](http://www.clustal.org/clustal2/). This is a GUI offline program for doing alignmnets with clustalw. 
     * You can also download and install [Jalview](http://www.jalview.org/getdown/release/) or the much more primitive [Seaview](http://doua.prabi.fr/software/seaview) to 
       view the alignments off line.
     * If you want to, you can create MSAs in R using the [msa](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/msa.html) Bioconductor package.
     * To view the trees, if you are not using the EBI interface, you can use [this online viewer](http://etetoolkit.org/treeview/)

 * Editing files: See [this guide](https://github.com/january3/Bioinformatics/blob/main/Resources/Editing_files/editing_text_files.pdf) on editing files.


# Exercises

## Sequence logos

 1. Use the online tool ([link 1](https://weblogo.berkeley.edu/examples.html),
   [link 2](http://weblogo.threeplusone.com/create.cgi)) to create sequence logos from the following sets of
    sequences:
 
      * Set 1: File [data/set1.fasta](data/set1.fasta)
      * Set 2: File [data/set2.fasta](data/set2.fasta)

 2. What are the *consensus sequences* of these motifs for these two sets?

 3. A *regular expression* in DNA sequence motifs uses the following UPAC
    codes to represent positions where multiple possibilities are
    represented by a single letter. E.g. "N" stands for any base, and "W"
    stands for A or T. Summarise the sequence logos in form of regular
    expression (that is, if at position 1 there are only A's and T's, write
    "W")

|Code |Stands for         |
|-----|-------------------|
|A    |Adenine            |
|G    |Guanine            |
|C    |Cytosine           |
|T    |Thymine            |
|Y    |Pyrimidine (C or T)|
|R    |Purine (A or G)    |
|W    |weak (A or T)      |
|S    |strong (G or C)    |
|K    |keto (T or G)      |
|M    |amino (C or A)     |
|D    |A, G, T (not C)    |
|V    |A, C, G (not T)    |
|H    |A, C, T (not G)    |
|B    |C, G, T (not A)    |
|X/N  |any base           |

 4. What happens if you change the GC contents parameter? E.g. set to 50%,
    to 25%, to 75% -> what happens?
 
 5. Go to the [JASPAR](http://jaspar.genereg.net/) database and search for
    the motifs "CTCF", "BATF3", "JUN::FOS" and "STAT3". Do any of these
    motifs look similar to the sequence logos you have created?


## Multiple sequence alignments

There are three data sets: 

  1. Data set 1, [hba.fasta](data/hba.fasta) are the hemoglobin alpha
     sequences from different species. 
  2. Data set 2, [globin.fasta](data/globin.fasta) are the different human globin sequences.
  3. Data set 3, [bhlh.fasta](data/bhlh.fasta) are different human bHLH proteins. There are more than 150
     such proteins; here is just a handful (mostly from "group C", as
     described
     [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC116727/)).

Here are the exercises:

  1. Open the FASTA file for data set 1. The names of the organisms are in
     latin. Do you know any of them? Search for the names you do not know.
     What are these organisms? How re they related to humans? Are all
     sequences HBA sequences?
  2. Using one of the online services or an offline program, create an MSA
     of data set 1. The main result file has an extension `.aln` (if you
     want to download it and e.g. view with an offline viewer). The guide
     tree is in the `.dnd` file. Both are text files that can be viewed in
     your browser.
  3. Inspect the MSA. Which sequences are close to the consensus? Which are
     more distant? Which regions are conserved?
  4. Inspect the guide tree. Is the real phylogeny reflected by this tree?
  5. Run the alignment and repeat the steps 2-4 using the data set 2 (human
     globin sequences). How does the alignment compare to the previous one?
     Which proteins cluster together? How does it relate to the alpha/beta
     hemoglobins as described in Lecture 4?
  6. Run the alignment and repeat the steps 2-4 using the data set 3. Which
     region is conserved?
  7. Pick one of the bHLH protein identifiers and search for it in
     [Swissprot/Uniprot](https://uniprot.org). Go to the "Family & Domains"
     section of the record for that protein. Which domain shows the
     greatest conservation? 
  8. (Hard) If there is a structure present for that
     protein (section "Structure"), which fragment of the structure does
     this conserved region correspond to? (Note: the structure may show
     more than one molecule! The table on the right shows which chain
     corresponds to the given protein; hovering cursor over the structure reveals
     to which chain a residue belongs to.)






# Homework


There are 20,000 human genes, pick one! No, seriously. You must have heard
of one protein or another. An enzyme? A transcription factor? Anything,
*but not* hemoglobin or bHLH. 

 1. Pick a protein. You are free to choose any of the 20,000 or so human
    proteins.
 2. Using BLASTP, find at least five homologous sequences *from other
    organisms*. You are allowed to pick specific organisms, of course.
 3. Create a multiple sequence alignment of these organism.
 4. Your homework is the `.aln` file created by the MSA program.
