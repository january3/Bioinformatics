# Prerequisites

Please install the following packages:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages(c("randomForest", "party", "MASS", "pROC"))
```

Please load the following three data sets:

```{r}
m_dat      <- read.csv("https://january3.github.io/Bioinformatics/Datasets/metabo_data.csv", 
                       row.names=1)
m_samples  <- read.csv("https://january3.github.io/Bioinformatics/Datasets/metabo_coldata.csv", 
                       row.names=1)
m_features <- read.csv("https://january3.github.io/Bioinformatics/Datasets/metabo_fdata.csv", 
                       row.names=1)
```


# Machine learning algorithms

There are numerous machine learning algorithms:

 * decision trees
   * with bagging
   * with boosting
   * random forests
 * support vector machines (SVMs)
 * projections to latent structures (PLS)
 * linear discriminant analysis
 * regression models (e.g. logistic regression, ridge regression, lasso
   regression, elastic nets)
 * neuronal networks
 * deep learning algorithms

Today, we will first apply LDA to the iris data set, and then we will apply
decision trees to a metabolome data set.

# Iris data set

## Creating a training and test set

```{r}
data(iris)
n <- nrow(iris) # 150
train <- sample(1:n, size=2/3 * n)
test  <- setdiff(1:n, train)

iris_train <- iris[train, ]
iris_test  <- iris[test,  ]
```

**Exercise. (5 min)** Make sure that you understand *exactly* what is happening
above. Ask questions if necessary. How many samples are in the training
set? How many in the test set? How many of each species is in the test set?
Are the group sizes balanced? (what does "balanced" mean?)

## LDA with the iris data set

First, we create a model for discriminating between versicolor and
virginica iris species only. 

```{r}
data(iris)
library(MASS)
library(tidyverse)
iris_train_vv <- iris_train %>% filter(Species != "setosa") %>%
  mutate(Species=factor(Species))
mod_lda_vv <- lda(Species ~ ., data=iris_train_vv)
```

The result is an object of class `lda`, which is a list. The element
`scaling` (`mod_lda_vv$scaling`) contains a matrix with the coefficients
for each of the four features (variables). We now can calculate the values
of the LD function for each of the samples. We use here the `predict`
function, but we are not predicting anything â€“ this is still the training
set.

```{r}
iris_train_vv_pred <- predict(mod_lda_vv, iris_train_vv)
iris_train_vv_pred <- iris_train_vv_pred$x[,1]
```

The element `x` of the object returned by `predict` is a matrix with one column containing the LD values. We can visualize
the data with a boxplot:

```{r}
df <- data.frame(Species=iris_train_vv$Species, LD=iris_train_vv_pred)
ggplot(df, aes(x=Species, y=LD)) + geom_boxplot()
```

We see that LD is high for *virginica* and low for *versicolor*.

**Exercise (5min)**. The coefficients for Sepals in the LD are negative,
while the coefficients for Petals are positive. LD is positive for *virginica*
and negative for *versicolor*. Question: based on this fact, are petals
larger in *virginica* or in *versicolor*?

## Making and testing predictions

We can now make predictions for the test set:

```{r}
iris_test_vv <- iris_test %>% filter(Species != "setosa") %>%
  mutate(Species=factor(Species))
iris_test_vv_pred <- predict(mod_lda_vv, iris_test_vv)
iris_test_vv_pred <- iris_test_vv_pred$x[,1]
df <- cbind(iris_test_vv, LD=iris_test_vv_pred)
ggplot(df, aes(x=Species, y=LD)) + geom_boxplot()
```

A natural cutoff seems to be for $LD = 0$. We now will confront the
predictions with reality.

```{r}
pred <- ifelse(iris_test_vv_pred > 0, "virginica", "versicolor")
table(pred, iris_test_vv$Species)
```

**Question.** What is the overall error rate?

**Homework 6, alternative 1**. Repeat the above analysis with the full iris data set
(three classes). You will find that the `x` part of the prediction object has now two
columns, `LD1` and `LD2`. Make boxplots for both of them. Which LD
discriminates between which species? [note: instead of this homework, you
are allowed to choose the "alternative 2" (only if we don't do it together
during practicals) and "alternative 3" below] Submit an Rmarkdown file.


# The metabo data set

The metabo data set contains metabolomic profiles for patients suffering
from tuberculosis (TB) and of two classes of healthy controls: LTBI, that is
individuals who are healthy, but infected with *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*, and CTRL,
who are healthy and uninfected.

```{r data_prep,eval=FALSE,echo=FALSE}
library(readxl)
f <- "/home/january/MPIB-01-08CO ClientDataTable.xls"
s <- "ScaledSparsedImpData"
dat <- read_excel(f, sheet = s, range="I13:EP401", col_names = FALSE,
                  col_types = "numeric") %>% data.matrix()
coldat <- read_excel(f, sheet = s, range="H1:EP10", col_names = FALSE,
                  col_types = "text") %>% t() %>% data.frame()
colnames(coldat) <- coldat[1,]
coldat <- coldat[-1, ]
coldat <- coldat %>% mutate(SAMPLE_NAME=gsub("-", "_", SAMPLE_NAME)) %>%
  select(SAMPLE_NAME, GENDER, GROUP1) %>%
  mutate(GROUP1=ifelse(GROUP1 == "A_TST_NEG", "CTRL",
                       ifelse(GROUP1 == "B_TST_POS", "LTBI", "TB"))) %>%
  mutate(GROUP2=ifelse(GROUP1 == "TB", "TB", "HEALTHY"))
colnames(dat) <- coldat[["SAMPLE_NAME"]]

fdat <- read_excel(f, sheet = s, range="A12:G401", col_names = TRUE,
                  col_types = "text") %>% 
        mutate(ID=paste0("ID_", 1:n())) %>% relocate(ID)
rownames(dat) <- fdat$ID
vars <- apply(dat, 1, var)
sel <- vars > quantile(vars, .1)

fdat <- fdat[sel, ]
dat  <-  dat[sel, ]

rownames(coldat) <- NULL

write.csv(dat, "../../Datasets/metabo_data.csv")
write.csv(fdat, "../../Datasets/metabo_fdata.csv")
write.csv(coldat, "../../Datasets/metabo_coldata.csv")
```

The data set consists of three data frames (which we loaded in the
"Prerequisites" section). 

**Exercise (5m).** Inspect the data files and tell me what they are.

First, we will remove all biochemicals without a known name:

```{r}
sel <- !grepl("^X-[0-9]*$", m_features$BIOCHEMICAL.NAME)
m_features <- m_features[sel, ]
m_dat <- m_dat[sel, ]
```


We will need a data frame containing the features in columns rather than
rows (we use GROUP2 for classification because it only has two classes):

```{r}
m_df <- data.frame(GROUP=factor(m_samples$GROUP2), t(m_dat))
```


Here is a PCA plot of the data:

```{r}
pca <- prcomp(t(m_dat), scale.=TRUE)
df <- data.frame(GROUP=m_samples$GROUP2, pca$x[,1:5])
ggplot(df, aes(x=PC1, y=PC2, color=GROUP)) + geom_point()
```


As before, we will create a training and test set selection.

```{r}
set.seed(12345678)
n <- nrow(m_samples) # number of samples
train <- sample(1:n, size=2/3 * n)
test  <- setdiff(1:n, train)
```


In the following, we will be creating various ML models for the data and
test their performance.

## Decision trees

To understand a decision tree it is best to just visualize it:

```{r}
library(party)

ct <- ctree(GROUP ~ ., data=m_df[ train, ])
plot(ct)
```

We will now discuss what is on that tree.

**Exercise. (5min)** What are the biochemicals which were selected by the
algorithm?


Now we can apply the model of the tree to the test data set:

```{r}
preds <- predict(ct, newdata=m_df[ test, ])
tmp <- table(preds, m_df[ test, ]$GROUP)
print(tmp)
```

Remember: columns correspond to the reality and rows to the predictions.
Therefore, we interpret the numbers as follows:

```{r echo=FALSE}
data.frame(
                 Abbr=c("TN", "FP", "FN", "TP"),
                 Name=c("true negative", "false positive", "false negative", "true positive"),
                 Description=c(
                               "prediction: HEALTHY, reality: HEALTHY",
                               "prediction: TB, reality: HEALTHY",
                               "prediction: HEALTHY, reality: TB",
                               "prediction: TB, reality: TB"),
                 Count=as.vector(tmp)) %>% pander()
```

**Exercise. (15')** Calculate the sensitivity, specificity, FPR and FDR. Consult
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity) if
necessary, specifically the frame on the right hand side.

## Running a leave-one-out crossvalidation (LOO-CV)

LOO-CV allows us to take advantage of almost all samples in the data set
when constructing a model, while avoiding overfitting.

The package `caret` contains many useful features for modeling and
cross-validation, however (i) it will be useful to see how LOO-CV works under
the hood and (ii) the package is not very straightforward to use.
Therefore, we will use our own code. With R vectorization it is quite
simple, really:

```{r cache=TRUE}
test_one <- function(df, i) {
  train <- df[-i, ]
  test  <- df[ i, ]
  ct <- ctree(GROUP ~ ., train)
  pred <- as.character(predict(ct, newdata=test))
  return(pred)
}

## warning! This takes a while
preds <- map_chr(1:nrow(m_df), ~ test_one(m_df, .x))
```

This results in the following performance:

```{r echo=FALSE}
tmp <- table(preds, m_df$GROUP)
pander(tmp)
```




## Random forests

One of the ways to improve the predictions from a decision tree is to
combine bootstrapping (using only parts of the data) with growing multiple
trees, each tree making its own decision. The grown "forest" of the trees
then casts a vote regarding a sample, and the majority wins.

One of the great advantages of random forests is that it delivers
out-of-bag (OOB) estimates which are nearly as good as the ones that you
get when doing cross-validation. This is why we are allowed to work here
with the full data set rather than with the training set.

```{r}
library(randomForest)
rf <- randomForest(GROUP ~ ., data=m_df, importance=TRUE)
print(rf)
```

**Note** that in the table above, the reality is *in rows*, and predictions are
*in columns* (reverse of what we were using before). Thus, `class.error`
corresponds to 1 - specificity (or FNR) and 1 - sensitivity (or FPR).

We now can check what would happen if we actually tested the model using
the data set that we used to train it:

```{r}
### INCORRECT!!!
preds <- predict(rf, m_df)
table(preds, m_df$GROUP)
```

The above is *vastly* overfit â€“ no errors at al! But this will not work
like that in a new data set.

### Variable importance

We cannot check individual trees (well, we can, but its complicated) to see
which metabolites play a role in the classification, but we can ask what
variables are most important *overall*:

```{r}
imp <- rf$importance %>% as.data.frame %>% 
  arrange(-MeanDecreaseAccuracy) %>% head(20)

merge(m_features, imp, by.x="ID", by.y=0) %>%
  dplyr::select(ID, BIOCHEMICAL.NAME, SUB.PATHWAY, HEALTHY, TB, 
         MeanDecreaseAccuracy) %>% knitr::kable()
```

Fine, but does that make sense? Let us plot some of the molecules.

```{r}
sel <- c("ID_24", "ID_169", "ID_70", "ID_139")
df <- m_df %>% dplyr::select(all_of(c("GROUP", sel))) %>% 
  pivot_longer(starts_with("ID"), names_to="ID", values_to="level")
ggplot(df, aes(x=GROUP, y=level))+   geom_boxplot() + 
  facet_wrap(~ ID, ncol=2) 
```


## ROC curves

To plot a ROC curve, we need a numeric predictor and not binary (yes / no)
predictions. To get these numeric predictor, we can use `predict` with
option `prob=TRUE` (this works for other algorithms as well!). *However* we
cannot do that for random forest: predictions would be overfit! We need the
*OOB* estimates of the probabilities.  These are stored in the rf object:

```{r}
probs <- rf$votes
head(probs)
```

The two columns indicate the percentage of votes each class got from the
trees, so `0.124` in column "HEALTHY" indicates that 12% of the trees
decided that this given sample comes from a healthy person (and 88% trees
decided that this is a TB patient). 

```{r results="markdown"}
probs_df <- as.data.frame(probs) %>% merge(m_samples, by.x=0, by.y="SAMPLE_NAME") %>% arrange(HEALTHY)
head(probs_df)
```



To plot a ROC curve, we use `roc` from package `pROC`. We need to supply
the `levels` argument to tell pROC which one is the positive and which one
is the negative:

```{r}
library(pROC)
roc(response=m_df$GROUP, predictor=probs[,1], 
    levels=c("HEALTHY", "TB"), plot=TRUE)
```

We can also calculate the area under the curve (AUC) and its confidence
intervals:

```{r}
roc(response=m_df$GROUP, predictor=probs[,1], 
    levels=c("HEALTHY", "TB"), ci=TRUE)
```

We can compare it with a roc curve from the decision tree model. However,
for this we need a slight modification of our LOO-CV function:

```{r cache=TRUE}
test_one <- function(df, i) {
  train <- df[-i, ]
  test  <- df[ i, ]
  ct <- ctree(GROUP ~ ., train)
  pred <- predict(ct, newdata=test, type="prob")[[1]][1]
  return(pred)
}

## warning! This takes a while
ct_probs <- map_dbl(1:nrow(m_df), ~ test_one(m_df, .x))
```

And plot the ROC curve:

```{r}
roc(response=m_df$GROUP, predictor=ct_probs, 
    plot=TRUE, 
    levels=c("HEALTHY", "TB"))
```


**Exercise â€“ optional (if we find time)**. Otherwise, **Homework 6,
alternative 2** (so if we don't manage to run it during practicals
together, you can do it as a homework). Use the metabo dataset and random
forests, but instead of "GROUP" take "SEX" as predictor. Which biochemicals
found in blood are indicative of biological sex? Submit an Rmarkdown file.


**Homework 6, alternative 3**. Another method of machine learning are the
Support Vector Machines (learn more
[here](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/support-vector-machines-r)).
An SVM algorithm is implemented in the function `svm` of the package
`e1071`. Train `svm` on the metabolomic training data set, test it on the
testing data set (using `predict`), calculate the sensitivity and
specificity. Submit an Rmarkdown file.
