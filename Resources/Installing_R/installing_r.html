<p>There are two options for you:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Use R from Rstudio. This is the way I will be using it during lectures / practicals, because I am more familiar with it.</p></li>
<li><p>Use R from Jupyter Notebook. That way is recommended by the university.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Installation instructions:</p>
<h1 id="installing-r-with-rstudio">Installing R with Rstudio</h1>
<p>There are two parts to that. First you need to install R, and <em>then</em> you need to install Rstudio. Please choose a recent version of R (&gt; 4.0).</p>
<p>Here are the links which will guide you through the installation process:</p>

<li>Install R on Ubuntu / Linux: should be straightforward, just go to the software app and search for rstudio; this will install R automatically as well.</li>

</ul>
<h1 id="installing-r-for-use-with-jupyter-notebook">Installing R for use with Jupyter Notebook</h1>
<p>This assumes that you have Jupyter Notebook already installed. What you now need is a so-called “kernel” – the part that actually runs R.</p>
<p>First, install R on your system (refer to the tutorials above on how to do it).</p>
<p>Then, open R and at its command line type the following:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">install.packages</span>(<span class="st">&quot;IRkernel&quot;</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
