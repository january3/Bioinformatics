# Marking

  The final mark consists of three parts:

   * Exam (multiple choice and free answers), 20 questions each for 2 points: maximum 40 points
   * Homeworks, 6 homeworks each rewarded with 5 points, total maximum 30 points
   * Report: maximum 30 points
  
  In addition, you can get up to 15 bonus points for 

   * active participation in the practicals and lectures; in especially,
     for asking questions and helping others
   * extra effort on homeworks and report
   * coming up with own, original ideas and implementing them during practicals or in
     the report

  However, **any** sign of plagiarism will result in **zero points** for
  the respective part of the exam. Plagiarism includes both copying from
  your colleagues (in which case both of you will receive 0 points) or from
  the internet.

  You are permitted to use large language models (LLMs, such as ChatGPT)
  and other resources to learn and train your skills, and even to check
  spelling or grammar. During the course, I will provide you with advice,
  instructions and caveats on how to use these tools safely and efficiently.

  However, you **are not allowed** to use any of these resources to
  straight out write the report, the homeworks or the exam. Any evidence of this will
  result in zero points for the respective part of the exam. Please keep in
  mind that detecting plagiarism or LLM use is much easier than you think.

  Any questions? Please ask!
